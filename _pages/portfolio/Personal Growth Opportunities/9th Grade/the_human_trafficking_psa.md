# About This Experience
To raise awareness on Human Trafficking, the Cabarrus County Human Trafficking Task Force held an event for parents and students to "...hear from members of the Task Force,... Law Enforcement, and Nonprofit Leaders" who are "actively combating the issue in Cabarrus County." In addition to the information that was presented, five student-made PSA's were chosen to be revealed at this event. To contribute to this event, I produced a film that describes human trafficking statistics in North Carolina. The video informs the viewer what human trafficking is, the number of cases in the United States and North Carolina per year, and the physical and mental effects of human trafficking on a person. The one minute and thirty-second video was selected as a finalist and presented at the event which I was able to attend.

On November 15, 2019, Mr. Scott Brown, a teacher at Northwest Cabarrus High School approached me with an extracurricular opportunity. This opportunity included producing a video on the topic of Human Trafficking that if selected, would be presented on at Kannapolis Performing Arts Center on January 27.

After many hours of video editing. I was able to submit a 1 minute and 30 second video. The final video was submitted on December 13. The video was approved as a finalist on January 17, 2020.

# The Event
As said before, the event was held at the Kannapolis Performing Arts Center. The event started at 6:00PM with an introduction and progression of the team working to fight human trafficking in Cabarrus County.

During the second half, of the event, the five student made PSA's were shown those attending. Before each video was presented, the creators of the video were asked to explain why they made the video and what the video explains. I explained how I did not realize this was such a huge problem in our local area and how anyone you know could be a victim.

My final video is shown below...

At the end of the event, my team and I received a 50$ gift card to a well known pizza service.

# Reflection
Even after winning a 50$ gift card, there are still changes I would have made looking back.

After the event and re-watching the video, I did notice that the audio and text timings were off*. I believe this was caused when the file was compressed to a size that could be sent in an email.

I also would have not made the concluding information as long. In the final video, this portion takes 19 seconds. If this was shortened, more information could have been put into the production.
