# About This Experience
During the week of November 30th, 2020, NCVirtual hosted numerous open house events via Zoom targeted towards North Carolina parents. The purpose of the open house was to allow parents to understand how virtual learning operates at the North Carolina Virtual Public School. To provide a student perspective of NCVirtual, a group of students including myself was asked to present information at the open house. At this event, I was able to explain to parents across North Carolina how they can help their children succeed in online learning. The items I presented included information on student access, the student success guide, student progress tracking, support from NCVirtual teachers, the NCVirtual Peer Tutoring Program, and the webinars and collaborations NCVirtual has available to its students.
