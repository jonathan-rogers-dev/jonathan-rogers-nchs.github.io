Other than tutoring students, I also provided tech support services to NCVirtual tutors and students. I have provided the following support services:
- Live Tech Support
- Status Pages
- Troubleshooting Pages
- Troubleshooting Videos

## Statuspage
To communicate errors and platform outages, I created multiple status pages to which all NCVirtual students have access. This site communicates issues with Canvas, Upswing, Zoom, and other platforms.

<a href="https://ptcresourcespage.statuspage.io/">Status page for Students</a>

<a href="https://peertutoringcenterservices.statuspage.io/">Status page for Tutors</a>

## Troubleshooting Pages and Videos
I created a Canvas page meant for students to personally troubleshoot issues they have with Upswing, our tutoring platform.
