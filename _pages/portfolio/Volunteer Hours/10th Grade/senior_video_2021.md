With Ms. Gregory advising, I was able to create a video that showcases the experience of seniors in the STEM program, graduating in 2021.

# Reflection
I am very glad that I was able to create this video to show my support for seniors who are graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic. The almost 11-minute video highlighted experiences from high school, teacher messages, and important quotes about the future. I am also very happy with the turn out of the video. The video, went through one main editing period, then four revision periods until the final video was produced and shared with STEM teachers. 

The only item I was disappointed about was the number of images from junior and senior year. Most images were from Freshman year, and because of this, the video was not a full reflection of the four years. Nonetheless, I am happy with the outcome and I wish the best for the seniors in this video.
